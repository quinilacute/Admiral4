                    <h3> History</h3>

                    <p>Admiral Trucker (Nig) Limited logistics operation history predates its birth as a unique Nigerian corporate citizen with its <br> incorporation on October 16th, 2008. Before that date, Admiral Trucker (Nig) Limited operated as an integral component of the multi- <br> venture concern, Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited, which businesses cover, truck sales and services-online terrestrial; internet-based  <br>automobile search engine services; sales/marketing of truck-related products and services; oil and gas haulage; general goods,<br> equipment shipment and logistics services.</p>
    
                    <p>With phenomenal growth of the unit components of the above-mentioned businesses come diverse operational challenges, which <br>necessitated a comprehensive reappraisal of the Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited business model. Closely moderated by Admiral <br> Autotraders (Nig) Limited core objective of raising the bar in all spheres of business it undertakes in Nigeria, the review exercise <br>involved inputs from employers and employees as well as its multi-faceted clientele base.</p>
    
                    <p>As against Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited integrated approach, coming to all submissions was the imperative of operational <br> independence for the various business divisions in the organisation. And having decided to adopt the Unit Independence Operational <br> Concept, management took another radical step by way of confering distinct corporate citizenship in the line with core trade or <br> operations areas on each business unit in Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited. The day-to-day operations of these business entities <br> would be executed without recourse to the centralised administrative apparatus of Admiral Autotraders (Nig) Limited, management <br> said, and thus was born Admiral Trucker (Nig) Limited on October 16th, 2008.</p>
